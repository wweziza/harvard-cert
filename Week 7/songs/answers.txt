Characterizing the Audio Aura:
To gauge a listener's audio aura, we can average the danceability, energy, and valence of their top 100 songs.

Limitations:

Mixed Genres: The list might not fully represent the listener's tastes due to its variety.
Context Ignored: It doesn't account for when or how the songs are listened to.
Changing Tastes: Preferences might shift over the year.

Better Methods:

Genre Analysis: Look at specific genres for clearer insights.
Track Changes: Monitor how preferences change over time.
Contextual Info: Consider the context in which songs are played.
These methods can provide a more accurate picture of the listenerâ€™s musical mood.
